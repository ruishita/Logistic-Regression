# Logistic-Regression
# The data used is Titanic.csv
Read the dataset into a dataframe. Display the first 5 rows of the dataframe.
Explore the dataset and determine what is the target variable.
Drop factor(s) that are not likely to be relevant for logistic regression.
Make sure there are no missing values. Handle missing values if any.
Plot count plots of each of the remaining factors (including the target variable).
Convert all categorical feature variables into dummy variables.
Partition the data into train and test sets (70/30). Use random_state = 2020.
Fit the training data to a logistic regression model.
Predict the outcomes for the test set.
Display the accuracy of your predictions for survivability.
Display the confusion matrix along with the labels (Yes, No). 
Now, display the predicted value of the survivability of a male adult passenger traveling in 3 rd class. 
Next, display the predicted probability of the survivability of a male adult passenger traveling in 3 rd class.
